# Locations of orbitals and their names / symmetry designations, etc.
# Positions are in cartesian coordinates
# First three parameters are numbers indicating the location of the orbital.
# Fourth parameter is the name of the orbital.
# Fifth parameter is the symmetry designation (Wyckoff position)
# Sixth parameter is the orbital symmetry (eg. dxy)
# Seventh parameter is the interaction group.

# Symmetries in the crystal.
# The numbers following the symmetry name indicate how the orbitals transform 
# under the symmetry.  If you specify the symmetry operation, you must specify
# one number for each orbital.  The orbital transforms are optional if the 
# orbitals transform into themselves.
