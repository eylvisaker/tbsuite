# Symmetries in the crystal.
# The numbers following the symmetry name indicate how the orbitals transform 
# under the symmetry.  If you specify the symmetry operation, you must specify
# one number for each orbital.  The orbital transforms are optional if the 
# orbitals transform into themselves.
